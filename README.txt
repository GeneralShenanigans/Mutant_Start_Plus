# Installation

Take the "data" folder you downloaded and drop it in the 'Cataclysm: The Last Generation' game folder so that the two data folders merge together. The necessary files should automatically go where they're supposed to after that, with no pop-up prompts (unless you're updating this mod I guess)

## "I installed the mod and it's not showing up!"

Ensure that you're checking in the "Balance" tab in the Mod List, when generating a world. It threw me off, too.


## Known Issues:

-Purchasing 'Inconveniently Large' at character creation has unintended interactions with adding random traits if taken and untaken too many times. Workaround is to simply take it as your first choice and then not mess with it further.
